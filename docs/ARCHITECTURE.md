# Architecture

## Boundary

`full-stack-auditor` is now centered on the thin agentic hunt path. The public driver is `fsa hunt`; the model decides the audit strategy and the framework supplies only capabilities, safety, confirmation gates, and replayable state.

The main layers are:

- Agent loop: `src/agent/loop.ts`, `src/agent/prompts.ts`, and `src/agent/hunt.ts`.
- Agent tools: `src/agent/tools.ts` for pi-style read/write/edit/bash capabilities.
- Ingestion: `src/ingest/source.ts` loads authorized source and corpus material with public-safe paths.
- Safety: `src/security/policy.ts` and `src/security/sandbox.ts` gate local command execution.
- Reporting and history: `src/reports`, `src/trace`, and `src/agent/memory.ts`.
- Provider adapters: `src/llm/pi-ai.ts`, with explicit local CLI fallbacks in `src/llm/codex-cli.ts` and `src/llm/claude-code.ts`.
- Pi integration: `src/pi/extension.ts` registers the `fsa_hunt` tool and shell guardrail.

  CONFIRM -->|no| HYP["hypothesis (unconfirmed)"]
  EXEC --> ARTIFACTS["findings + reports + history"]
  HYP --> HYPART["hypotheses artifact (no report)"]
```

The loop has one protocol: the model emits exactly one JSON tool action per turn, or a `done` object after writing `findings.json`. The framework parses it, runs the requested tool, appends the observation, and calls the model again until the agent finishes or the step budget is exhausted.

## Thin-Layer Rule

A component belongs in hunt mode only if it gives the model something it cannot provide for itself:

- an affordance: read source, write/edit a copied workspace, inspect with local commands, run a local test;
- a guarantee: sandbox isolation, command safety, path redaction, replayable logs, durable history, executable-confirmation gating.

A component does not belong in the default hunt path if it tells the model what bug class to look for, what schedule to follow, or what conclusion to reach. If a human prior is still useful, expose it as an optional model-callable tool.

## Tool Surface

Default tools:

- `read`: read loaded source/corpus or files created in the sandbox.
- `write`: write bounded files into the copied sandbox workspace.
- `edit`: replace text in a file inside the copied sandbox workspace.
- `bash`: run one policy-gated local command in the copied workspace. `purpose=inspect` (default) is for exploration (`ls`/`find`/`rg`/`cat`/`sed`/reads) and never confirms anything; `purpose=confirm` must be a real local test/build runner (`cargo test`, `forge test`, `go test`, `node --test`, `pytest`, …) with success patterns, and only it can mint confirmation.

There are no default bug-class, dataflow, checklist, memory, or report tools. Optional priors should live as extension skills, prompt packs, corpus material, or package add-ons, not as default strategy in hunt mode.

## Confirmation Boundary

The hard rule is that the model cannot confirm a bug by assertion. Artifact semantics enforce it:

- A **finding** is a candidate that cited a `bash` `command_id` of a `purpose=confirm` run that passed (expected exit status plus every declared success pattern). Only findings get `confirmed-executable` status, enter `hunt_findings.json`/`summary.findings`, and get a disclosure report.
- A **hypothesis** is any other candidate. Hypotheses are recorded prominently in `hunt_hypotheses.json` and counted in `summary.coverage.hypotheses`, but they are not findings and get no report.

Confirmation requires a real test/build runner. An inspection command (`cat`, `rg`, …) can never mint confirmation even with `purpose=confirm` and a matching success pattern — otherwise a model could forge proof by printing a success string from a file it wrote itself (`isAgentConfirmCommand` in `src/security/policy.ts`).

`bash` routes through `src/security/sandbox.ts` and the command-safety policy. It must stay local-only: source inspection, unit tests, fixtures, local regtest/devnet, forked local nodes, or isolated harnesses. Public network broadcast, transfer, credential use, persistence, exploit optimization, destructive commands, and paths outside the copied workspace are blocked.

## Verification Environment

Confirmation is only reachable if the model's local test can compile and run, which on a real target requires the toolchain's dependencies. Before the loop, `src/agent/prepare.ts` warms the copied workspace once: it detects the toolchain (Cargo, Go, npm/pnpm/yarn, Foundry) and runs the project's own dependency fetch/build (`cargo fetch` + `cargo build --tests`, `go mod download`, `npm ci`, `forge build`, …) with network allowed and a generous timeout (`AuditorConfig.huntPrepareTimeoutMs`), populating the workspace-local caches (`CARGO_HOME`, `GOMODCACHE`, npm cache) that `runSandboxCommand` already points inside the workspace. Afterwards the model's `bash` test runs are incremental and can run offline and reproducibly. These commands are framework-chosen (not model input) and run the target's own dependency build scripts in the isolated workspace; the step is gated by `AuditorConfig.huntPrepare` (default on, `--no-prepare` to skip) and is a no-op when no manifest is present.

The next hardening target is to make executable confirmation less self-certifying: a generic passing test or printed success string should not be enough to prove exploitability. Confirmation should prefer tests that touch target code, exercise the vulnerable condition, and match framework- or verifier-owned success signals.

## Memory And History

Each hunt writes:

- `hunt_transcript.json`: action/observation replay.
- `hunt_findings.json`: execution-confirmed findings only.
- `hunt_hypotheses.json`: unconfirmed candidates.
- `hunt_command_runs.json`: sandboxed local command records.
- `hunt_prepare.json`: toolchain warm-up results (when a manifest was detected).
- `summary.json`: ranked summary (findings) with `coverage.hypotheses`.
- `report_<id>.md`: private disclosure drafts, for confirmed findings only.
- `events.jsonl` and `calls/*.json`: trace and model calls.

Per-target memory lives at `<out>/history/<target>/memory.jsonl`. Hunt surfaces recent memory at kickoff and automatically stores parsed findings for later runs.

Project history lives under `<out>/history/<target>/manifest.json` and records sanitized run metadata, findings, and materials. Paths must stay repository-relative or placeholder-based in public-facing artifacts.

## Provider Behavior

Model calls use pi-ai providers by default. `provider=codex-cli` and `provider=claude-code` are explicit local CLI fallbacks. CLI fallbacks run non-interactively and must preserve the hunt contract: in agentic mode they must not inject "do not inspect files" instructions, because the framework tools are how the model investigates.

Model and provider selection stays runtime-configured. Do not assume every model family is available through every provider.

For blind benchmarks with `provider=codex-cli`, set `FSA_CODEX_WEB_SEARCH=disabled` to prevent public-report contamination. Real audits may leave Codex web search at its runtime default or set `FSA_CODEX_WEB_SEARCH=live|cached|disabled` explicitly.

## Pi Integration

The package extension exposes `fsa_hunt` and installs the shared shell-command guardrail. It does not expose a staged audit driver.

The command guardrail lives in `src/security/policy.ts` so non-pi integrations can reuse the same policy.

## Runnable Gates

- `npm run check`: strict TypeScript compile.
- `npm test`: build plus Node tests.
- `npm run mock-hunt`: deterministic offline hunt smoke test.
- `npm run check:blind-discovery`: local seeder regression check for optional planning aids.
- `npm run check:public`: public-surface scan for secrets and local paths.
- `npm run verify`: full local gate.

## White-Hat Constraints

- Audit only authorized source code.
- Keep verification local-only.
- Never broadcast transactions or target public networks.
- Treat model output as untrusted input.
- Validate structured output and sanitize paths.
- Keep audit artifacts private by default.
